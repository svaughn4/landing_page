                    Swimming was my first sport. I fell in love with it at the age of 6.

                    <p> I swam for 8 years. My first swim season was on my school team in Luanda, Angola.
                        When I moved back to the states, I swam on a competitive team for 4 years. Then, 
                        in Buenos Aires, Argentina I swam on the competitive school team for 2 years.</p>

                    <p> I picked up a basketball for the first time at age 8. I played the sport later 
                        for 2 years in Argentina on the school team. Each year we traveled to Uruguay or Brazil
                        to compete in a tournament with other international schools.

                    <p> My favorite sport of all: beach volleyball. I started playing indoor volleyball
                        in the second grade or age 8. At the time, there was no second grade team so I played up
                        on the fifth grade team. I played on my school team for 3 years. Then, when I moved to 
                        Argentina, I joined an Argentine club team in the sixth grade. I played there for
                        2 and a half years before moving back to the states. I played on the JV team at O'Dowd for 2 years
                        and then on varsity for the next 2. In both of those varsity seasons, we made it to the semi-finals 
                        or finals of CIF Playoffs. I was introduced to beach volleyball the summer going into high school.
                        Signing up was one of the best decisions I've ever made. Starting the end of sophomore year,
                        I competed in beach volleyball along with indoor volleyball tournaments.
