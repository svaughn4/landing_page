        <h1> About Sydney</h1> 
        <p> 
            So you want to learn more about me! I was born in Castro Valley, California back in 2002.
            However, I was raised around the world due to my mom's job. Our first relocation was to 
            Luanda, Angola where we lived for 3 years. During this time, we were fortunate enough 
            to travel around Europa, Asia, and Africa all of which these experiences strengthened my 
            curiosity, determination, and open-mindedness. Attending an international school as well
            positioned me in a intellectually, culturally, and socially diverse bubble that deepened
            my appreciation for difference in thought and values. 
        </p>

            Then, we moved back to the Bay Area where I attended 2nd through 5th grade at a Catholic School.
            In the 6th grade, my mom received an offer in Buenos Aires, Argentina so we moved and resided
            there for 2 and a half years. There, I became fluent in Spanish: partly because of the 
            international school setting and partly because of the cultural immersion outside of school.
            I spoke Spanish at the grocery stores, cafes, my club volleyball team, and with locals. 
            During our time here, my family and I explored South America: Per√∫, Uruguay, Brasil, and Chile.
        </p>

            After 8th grade, we moved back to the states. I attended Bishop O'Dowd High School for 4 years 
            where I was introduced to power club indoor and beach volleyball. Fast forward, I am now
            a rising junior at Stanford where I still consider myself the same inquistive, driven, and 
            open-minded Sydney.
